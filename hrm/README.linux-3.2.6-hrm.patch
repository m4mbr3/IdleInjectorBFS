The patch contains the diff from vanilla linux-3.2.6 to the latest version of
HRM backported from the AcOS repository (now based on linux-3.3.6).
I tried to apply the patch to a vanilla 3.2.6 kernel and to compile, install,
boot, and try out HRM and all seems to work.
You can use tha patch to enable HRM in your kernel (it should apply with, at
most, few conflicts if you change something relevant) and use HRM to gather
execution data.
The HRM-related userspace tools are located under /tools/libhrm.
Contact me in case you need help in using HRM or need instrumented benchmarks
for the experimental evaluation of your work (we have some of the apps of the
PARSEC 2.1 suite already instrumented).

Ciao.
